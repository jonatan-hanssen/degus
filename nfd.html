		What is better than owning a deguscoin? Owning a proof of ownership on an actual degus in the chilean wilderness on the degus blockchain, of course! For the low price of 10 deguscoins, you can claim your very own non fungible degus. 

		<h5> Terms and conditions for NFDs </h5>

		<ul>
			<li>A non fungible degus, hereby referred to as an NFD, represents proof of ownership of a theoretical degus in the chilean wilderness. It does not necessarily represent any specific degus, or any degus at all</li>
			<li>The Degus Corporation offers no guarantee that the degus hypothetically represented by the NFD is still alive, or ever was alive</li>
			<li>If the degus represented by a specific NFD ever leaves the chilean wilderness, for example by venturing into the cites of Iquique or Antofagasta, or by crossing the long Argentine-Chilean border into the Argentinian wilderness, the NFD will immediately be destroyed through the process of "degus termination". The degus however, will be fine</li>
			<li>The Degus Corporation does not offer tours of the chilean wilderness, or offer any way to contact the degus, or interact with the degus in any way</li>
			<li>If a degus wishes to expropriate the NFD that represents it, it may do so by contacting the Degus Corporation</li>
			<li>It is possible for several NFDs to represent a single degus, or for several deguses to represent a single NFD (degus duplication), but this is very unlikely and should be avoided</li>
		</ul> 

		<h5>Below are some examples of deguses which, in theory, could be represented by an NFD:</h5>
