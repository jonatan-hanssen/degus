		So you are ready to make the next step towards true enlightenment? <b>Congratulations</b>. To purchase a deguscoin: simply visit one of the following exchanges:

		<ul>
			<li><b><strike>FTX</strike></b>: As of november 2022, FTX is no longer operational and has declared bankruptcy. It is estimated that around fifteen thousand deguscoins were lost in the bankruptcy. Financial audits have revealed that a large majority of these deguscoins were transferred to the account of a degus named "George" in the days leading up to the collapse</li>
			<li><b><strike>BlockFi</strike></b>: Because of the collapse of FTX, to which BlockFi had major exposure in the form of six thousand deguscoins, BlockFi has also filed for bankruptcy</li>
			<li><b><strike>Celsius</strike></b>: Little is known about this exchange, but it is clear that it is bankrupt</li>
			<li><b>Degus Exchange</b>: By travelling to the Valdivian forest in Chile, it may be possible to trade for deguscoins with the local deguses. It is recommended to bring nuts and small trinkets as barter</li>
